# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Coding Agent Playbook — Codex Edition.

This repository is intentionally public and reusable. Contributions should make the playbook clearer, more durable, and less tool-specific.

## What Belongs Here

Good contributions include bug reports, documentation fixes, routing improvements, new skills, agent profiles, evidence-backed benchmark runs, methodology improvements, clearer global coding-agent instructions, reusable reference document templates, and generic examples that are easy to adapt.

## What Does Not Belong Here

Avoid adding:

- organization-specific workflows
- private project names
- local machine quirks
- internal URLs
- sensitive access material
- full thread transcripts
- long incident logs
- instructions tied to one tool unless the file is explicitly an example

## Style

- Prefer concise, direct language.
- Keep guidance tool-agnostic unless the file is explicitly tool-specific.
- Prefer behavior and decision rules over rigid command sequences.
- Use examples that are generic and safe for public reuse.
- Keep the main-agent orchestration, fixed Luna/max routing, bounded hierarchy, permit, scope and authority limits, and task-local worktree lifecycle model intact.
- Compare generic policy changes with the companion Claude Code playbook. Align shared behavior or document the concrete harness capability that requires a difference.
- For routing, skills, and agent-profile changes, explain the task boundary and validation evidence rather than asserting a model choice is universally best.
- For benchmark contributions, use [`docs/evidence/RUN-TEMPLATE.md`](docs/evidence/RUN-TEMPLATE.md), distinguish public reproduction from private field work, and report missing evidence as missing.
- Never include secrets, private code, confidential client information, credentials, private logs, or material you do not have permission to publish.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before opening a PR:

- Review Markdown formatting and fenced code blocks.
- Confirm links and paths match the repository tree.
- Confirm `SKILL.md` files include `name` and `description` frontmatter.
- Confirm `agents/*.toml` files are syntactically valid and define explicit `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` values if changed.
- Confirm every bundled role retains its base and `-luna` profiles, every child uses `gpt-5.6-luna` with `max` reasoning, and all profiles retain clear stop conditions.
- Confirm Unix shell scripts remain LF-only.
- Confirm generic policy changes were compared with the companion Claude Code playbook and any intentional divergence names its harness-specific reason.
- Confirm no sensitive or private material was added.
- For evidence or benchmark changes, confirm claims have a reproducible source, a correction/review trail where applicable, and no invented results.
