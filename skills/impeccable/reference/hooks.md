# $impeccable hooks

Manage the **design detector hook** for the current project.

The Codex hook runs the design detector after edits to design-relevant source files. The immediate pass covers mechanical issues; when the host supports the completion event, a later pass covers the remaining touched UI files. Hook availability depends on the installed Codex and Impeccable versions. A manual detector run remains available when automatic hooks are unavailable.

Before a hook command that writes configuration, inspect its supported options and exact destinations. This package targets Codex project configuration only. Do not execute an upstream automatic hook installer or reset that would change other coding-agent environments. If the installed engine cannot restrict its writes to the authorized Codex target, report that limitation and use a manual detector run; configuring a host hook requires its supported current schema.

Every hook is a mechanical pass. The reflexes no scanner catches live in [craft-floor.md](craft-floor.md), which the skill loads before it edits UI, so they apply whether or not a hook is wired. A session with no automatic hook gets one `MANUAL_DETECTOR_REQUIRED` directive from `impeccable context` asking for a single detector run at the end.

This command toggles the hook **per project** by editing `.impeccable/config.json` (the unified Impeccable config; hook runtime settings live under its `hook` key, and shared detector ignores live under `detector`). Per-developer overrides, including the install consent decision (`hook.consent`) the CLI records, live in the gitignored `.impeccable/config.local.json`. Set `hook.enabled: false` to turn the hook off, `hook.quiet: true` to silence the clean/pending acks, or `hook.auditLog` to a file path for an NDJSON log. The legacy `IMPECCABLE_HOOK_DISABLED`, `IMPECCABLE_HOOK_QUIET`, and `IMPECCABLE_HOOK_LOG` env vars are still honored and override these config values when set.

Declare server-side template extensions under **`detector.extensions`** when the project uses Blade, Twig, ERB, or Handlebars files; the hook skips them otherwise because they sit outside the built-in extension list. One entry per extension, `{ "ext": ".blade.php", "engine": "html" }`. `engine` picks the analyzer (`html` for markup templates, `text` for JS/TS/CSS-like files) and defaults to `html`. Match against the end of the filename, so double extensions like `.blade.php` and `.html.erb` work. Config only adds extensions; the built-in list always applies.

Manual `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable detect` scans use the same project filter config by default: `detector.ignoreRules`, `detector.ignoreFiles`, `detector.ignoreValues`, and `detector.designSystem.enabled`. `hook.enabled` only controls automatic hook execution, not manual CLI scans. Use `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable detect --no-config ...` for a raw detector run that ignores project config/context. Use `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable ignores ...` for direct CLI management of the same detector ignores.

The Codex project hook configuration is `.codex/hooks.json` when supported by the host. Preserve existing entries and the host's trust or approval requirements. Installing this skill does not create a hook configuration.

## Routing

The first argument is the action. Defaults to `status`.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `status` | Print current state, shared/local config paths, ignored rules / files / values, env override. |
| `on` | Upstream writes project config and provider hook manifests. Invoke only after proving the engine can restrict those writes to the authorized Codex target; otherwise use manual detection. |
| `off` | Set `enabled: false` in `.impeccable/config.json`. |
| `ignore-rule <id>` | Append `<id>` to `detector.ignoreRules`; for `overused-font`, requires `--all-values`. Suppresses the rule across the whole project. |
| `ignore-file <glob>` | Append `<glob>` to `detector.ignoreFiles`. Suppresses **every** rule for matching files. |
| `ignore-value <id> <value> [--shared] [--reason "..."]` | Append a rule/value suppression to shared `.impeccable/config.json`. |
| `ignore-value <id> <value> --local [--reason "..."]` | Append a private rule/value suppression to `.impeccable/config.local.json`. |
| `ignore-value <id> "*" --file <glob> [--file <glob>...]` | Turn one rule off in matching files only, leaving it active everywhere else. Repeat `--file`, or use `--file=<glob>` / `--files=<glob>`. A bare `"*"` with no `--file` is refused: use `ignore-rule <id>` if you really mean project-wide. |
| `reset` | Upstream removes project config and provider hook state. Invoke only when every actual destination is within the authorized Codex cleanup scope; preserve unrelated configuration and data. |

## Flow

1. Resolve the action from the user's argument. If no action was given, default to `status`.
2. After verifying the command's write scope as described above, invoke the admin script. Report its relevant result without exposing sensitive runtime output:

   ```bash
   <skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable hooks <action> [args...]
   ```

3. If `<action>` is `off`, follow up with a one-line note: "Done. New edits will not trigger the design hook in this project until you run `$impeccable hooks on`."
4. If `<action>` is `on`, follow up with: "Done. The design hook will fire after the next Edit/Write on a UI file."
5. If `<action>` is `ignore-value`, `ignore-file`, or `ignore-rule`, just print the script output. The default scope is shared `.impeccable/config.json`; add `--local` only when the user explicitly asks for a private exception.
6. If `<action>` is `status`, just print the script output. Do not add commentary unless the user asked a follow-up question.

## Triage findings

The hook itself never writes ignore config; every exception goes through `impeccable hooks`. Triage each finding into one of three outcomes:

- **Real design problem**: fix it. Never add an ignore to skip a fix or to push a blocked write through.
- **Confident false positive or sanctioned exception**: persist the narrowest ignore yourself and disclose it in your reply. The bar is evidence you can name: an intentional demo or fixture, documentation of bad design, literal or domain-appropriate motion (a ball that bounces), or a choice the user already confirmed. Put that evidence in `--reason` as `"<who decided: evidence>"`; write "user confirmed" only when the user actually did.
- **Unsure**: leave the finding standing and ask the user in one line. Ask once; a one-line question costs less than the hook re-firing on every later edit.

Self-serve stops at `ignore-value`. `ignore-file` and `ignore-rule` silence too much to add on your own judgment; ask the user first.

Prefer the narrowest exception:

- If the finding line shows an `ignore-value <rule> <value>` pair, pass it to `impeccable hooks ignore-value` with your `--reason`. This writes shared `.impeccable/config.json` by default.
- For value-specific findings such as `overused-font` and `bounce-easing`, use `ignore-value` for the specific value. Do not use `ignore-rule overused-font` for a specific font.
- If the finding has no value-specific command, such as `side-tab`, scope that one rule to the file: `ignore-value <id> "*" --file <path>`. Run `npx impeccable detect <path>` first to see what actually fires there.
- Reach for `ignore-file <path>` only when the whole file is out of scope for design review: a fixture, a generated artifact, a deliberate slop demo. It silences every rule for that file permanently, including rules that have not been written yet. A real UI surface with one noisy rule wants the file-scoped value ignore above.
- Use `ignore-rule <id>` only when the user asks to suppress that whole rule across the project. For broad overused-font suppression, use `ignore-rule overused-font --all-values` only when the user asks to ignore overused fonts generally.
- Prefer config ignores (the commands above) by default; they keep suppressions in one reviewable place. Reach for an inline comment only when the waiver must travel with a single file that leaves the repo (a generated/exported standalone document, an emailed HTML file). The supported marker is `impeccable-disable <rule>` (whole file) or `impeccable-disable-line` / `impeccable-disable-next-line` (one line), in any comment syntax, with an optional reason after `:` or `--`. The detector honors it by default; `--no-inline-ignores` or `--no-config` bypasses it.

Example value-specific exception:

```bash
<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable hooks ignore-value overused-font Inter --shared --reason "User confirmed Inter is intentional"
```

Example self-served exception, with the evidence named:

```bash
<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable hooks ignore-value bounce-easing bounce-ball --shared --reason "Agent: literal ball-bounce animation, bounce easing is the subject"
```

Example whole-rule font exception:

```bash
<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable hooks ignore-rule overused-font --all-values --reason "User asked to ignore overused fonts generally"
```

Example one-rule-in-one-file exception, for a file that is still worth reviewing
for everything else:

```bash
<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable hooks ignore-value design-system-font-size "*" --file "src/overlay/widget.js" --reason "Injected widget builds its own type scale; DESIGN.md's ramp describes the site"
```

Example whole-file exception, for a file that is out of scope entirely:

```bash
<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable hooks ignore-file "src/legacy/Card.tsx"
```

## Constraints

- Never modify `.impeccable/config.json` or `.impeccable/config.local.json` by hand from this command. Always go through `impeccable hooks` so writes stay validated and the file shape stays consistent. One exception: `detector.extensions` has no admin action, so when the user asks to cover a template stack, edit that one field in `.impeccable/config.json` directly and leave the rest of the file untouched.
- Do not edit the launcher or the binary behind `impeccable hook` and `impeccable hook-before-edit` from this flow. Those are skill plumbing.
- Automatic hook support, event names, and trust controls must be checked against the current Codex host. Report unsupported automation honestly; a manual detector run is a separate verification path.

## Failure modes

- If `.impeccable/config.json` or `.impeccable/config.local.json` is unreadable or malformed, the hook ignores that file and uses the remaining valid config/defaults. `impeccable hooks status` will show malformed files as ignored.
- If the user asks to "disable the hook" globally, lead with `$impeccable hooks off` (persistent for this project; writes `hook.enabled: false` to config). The legacy `IMPECCABLE_HOOK_DISABLED=1` env var also works as a one-shot override that follows the shell.
