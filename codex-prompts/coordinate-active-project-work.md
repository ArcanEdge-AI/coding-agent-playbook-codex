# Prompt: Coordinate Active Project Work

Use this prompt when multiple Codex threads are working on related features in the same project.

```markdown
Coordinate all active work for the current project.

Use the `multi-session-coordination` skill and its packaged references. Use the `worktree-lifecycle` skill when any participating task owns or proposes an auxiliary worktree. Use the `feature-branch-lifecycle` skill when development branches must converge through one feature integration branch or when promotion and temporary-branch cleanup are in scope.

Identify the current project, repository, default branch, active branch, and available worktrees from the environment. Do not ask me for information that can be detected reliably.

When creating a new project thread, use `Project - Three-to-Four-Word Description`. Detect the project name and derive the description from the primary objective. Do not include literal square brackets or ask me for a title when the project and task are already clear.

Begin with related Codex threads active during the previous 72 hours. Include older work when repository evidence shows that it remains unmerged, incomplete, blocked, contract-relevant, or otherwise active.

When direct thread discovery is unavailable, inspect branches, worktrees, pull requests, commits, diffs, tests, and optional active-work records. Clearly distinguish directly reviewed threads from repository-inferred work and identify any potentially missing work.

Classify relevant checkouts as host-managed primary, user-managed existing, or task-created auxiliary. Do not infer cleanup authority from age, inactivity, or clean status. Require each owning task to integrate and remove its own safe task-created auxiliaries or preserve them with exact blocker evidence; do not defer that responsibility to scheduled automation.

Build a shared change map and identify conflicts across files, architecture, APIs, events, schemas, migrations, shared types, dependencies, authentication, user flows, and tests. Do not limit the review to Git merge conflicts.

When the feature-branch lifecycle applies, resolve the repository's actual integration and production branch names. Record each branch's role, permitted merge target, promotion state, and cleanup eligibility. Do not invent missing long-lived branches or infer branch-deletion or production authority from this prompt.

For each dependency, distinguish a software or service dependency from an accepted upstream work artifact or decision. Identify unmet blockers, handoff and integration verification gates, and the remaining chain of blocking work that controls integration completion.

Assign clear ownership for shared areas, recommend the safest implementation order, identify work that should continue or pause, and provide copy-ready instructions for each active thread.

Return:

1. Executive summary
2. Discovery coverage
3. Active work summary
4. Shared change map
5. Conflict and overlap matrix
6. Ranked integration risks
7. Recommended implementation order
8. Instructions for each thread
9. Integration verification checklist
10. Open decisions requiring my approval

Do not implement changes unless I explicitly ask. Do not claim complete coverage when relevant thread context is inaccessible. Ask for a specific thread identifier only when missing context materially prevents a safe coordination decision.
```

Optional constraints can be added in plain language, for example:

- Prioritize one feature.
- Include a known thread.
- Exclude an abandoned branch.
- Prevent database changes until approval.
- Coordinate only planning and review work.
