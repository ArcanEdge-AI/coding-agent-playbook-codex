# Global Codex Reference Documents

This directory contains global reference documents that the main Codex agent uses to orchestrate repository work, route subagent execution, review, validate, and coordinate work.

These documents are intentionally generic and tool-agnostic. They should not contain repo-specific workflows, sensitive access material, local machine quirks, project names, or one-off incident notes.

## How to Use These References

The main agent should:

1. Start with the current user request and applicable repository instructions.
2. Inspect current code, tests, configuration, and docs.
3. Consult only the global reference documents that are relevant.
4. Treat reference docs as supporting context, not automatic truth.
5. Route bounded execution to at least one subagent for every repository task when subagents are available, and pass only relevant context.
6. Resolve conflicts using primary evidence.

Primary evidence includes:

- current code
- tests
- schemas
- configuration
- logs
- build output
- typecheck output
- runtime behavior
- authoritative external documentation

## Placement Rules

Use global references for durable, cross-repository guidance.

Use repository-level docs for:

- repo architecture
- repo build/test commands
- repo release flow
- repo-specific design rules
- framework-specific conventions
- domain-specific business logic
- project-specific subagent roles
- project-specific active-work records

Use skills for repeatable workflows.

Use local notes for machine-specific or shell-specific quirks.
